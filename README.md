INTRODUCTION
Our project is about building a machine learning model 
which analyzes review based on performance thereby 
generating a score and use sentimental analysis to check 
the polarity of situation wherein it can be a deciding 
factor. We also aim at building a model which generates 
a graphical representation of the data generated after 
cleaning the dataset, we tend to remove unpleasant or 
derogatory terms which affects the mental well-being of 
users or people who reads the reviews, last but not least 
we plan on automating this manual labor thus reducing 
the time which the user of the product spends on it and 
creating a safe and healthy platform for all
The introductory part is further divided into the 
following section
1. Problem statement.
2. Motivation for solving the problem.
3. Solution.
4. Background knowledge
Sentiment Analysis is a popular in machine learning to 
analyze the text and find the polarity like positive and 
negative. We use the sentiment analysis in machine 
learning model to predict the emotion of a people based 
on the text written.
While working on this project we mainly relied on the 
sentimental analysis factor which these days has been a 
go to approach for almost each and every platform not 
only its one of the most used common approach but also 
it has a wide range of usefulness like
• Emotion detection
• Aspect based analysis.
• Multilingual sentiment analysis and comes with many 

RELATED WORK
Sentimental analysis is used in a broad range of works
relating from social media monitoring apps like twitter 
etc. to brand based review collection like Myntra/ajio 
therefore we attached examples of each under division\\
Social Media Monitoring:
Sentiment Analysis is widely used in the so many 
platforms to know the behavior of person based on their 
text. Sentiment Analysis is used in the social media 
monitoring to know the user feeling while using their 
product. 
Let’s us take about the twitter is a big social media 
network around the world. Twitter use the sentiment 
analysis and they allow companies to understand their 
users felling about their brand and its helps to know 
their competitors and they can focus on keep in demand 
on their product and introduce the new trends and keep 
on update to present trends needs. To perform the 
sentiment analysis on twitter has to follow steps. 
Initially twitter has to gather twitter data and they have 
clear idea about type of tweets they want. After that 
prepare the data and clean it includes the removal of 
irrelevant information and delete the duplicated data. 
So, we need to create the sentiment analysis machine 
learning model in this step we have to train the model to 
predict the emotions based on the data. We train the 
model in this phase to predict the positive and negative 
of statements from the following the data. After the 
sentiment analysis model training, we will analyze the 
twitter data for sentiment. They final step is visualize 
the results. Twitter sentiment analysis allows us to keep 
track about your product on social media it will detects 
the customer feelings before they escalate.
Brand monitoring:
Sentiment Analysis is used in brand monitoring. Brand 
monitoring is a basically know the what people think 
about their brand. Every company wants to know about 
their product in market it will beneficial to their brand. 
To get the information company tries to get it from the 
different number of channel and media. Company also 
searches the shopping sites like amazon reviews. With

the help of this they can able to improve their service to 
their product. 
First Companies has to find the data comes 
from different ways like twitter and Facebook and 
shopping apps reviews etc. After that we need to filter 
the statements like positive or negative with the brand 
sentiment analysis algorithm. The major thing is 
analyzing the information it is important task is not only 
finding the negative and positive but need to know who, 
where, what the particular terms we need to keep in 
mind. We need to find which type of targeted people are 
giving the positive feedback and which type of targeted 
people are given negative feedback we need to analysis. 
So, with the help of this information the company can 
alerts and focus to improve the product.
The major step is Prevent the crisis. Let’s us 
take an example your product has gave the negative 
feedback in shopping app we get notified by the 
sentiment analysis model. So, we to apologize the 
customer for the product and give the compensation 
voucher to prevent loss or not a mistake from company 
the company has to defend them self. 
Customer feedback:
Sentiment Analysis is used in customer feedback. 
Basically, the customer feedback is the process of 
detecting the emotions of a customer interact with the 
products and services. In the customer feedback we 
mainly use the Natural language Processing and use the 
algorithm to detect the emotions of a customers. The 
algorithm main focus on the two parameters they are 
polarity and magnitude. Polarity is used for detect the 
positive and negative whereas magnitude is used for 
emotions exhibited by customer.
For performance of customer feedback, we need the 
data sets from different resources. Collect the data from 
the live chat. We need to collect the customer feedback 
every live chat. With the help of it we need to classify 
the feedback into respective terms. We need to collect 
the customer sentiment analysis from the social media. 
Social media platform such as twitter and Facebook we 
need to collect the data like “good”,” bad”,” hate”, 
“awesome” such kind of positive or negative word. 
With the help of it we can collect data. To know our 
product, conduct the online surveys to get better in view 
of the customer side. Monitor the reviews and ratings in 
shopping apps like amazon, google play, Ajio. It is best 
way to predict the customer feelings and sentiment 
analysis.
