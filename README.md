INTRODUCTION
Our project is about building a machine learning model 
which analyzes review based on performance thereby 
generating a score and use sentimental analysis to check 
the polarity of situation wherein it can be a deciding 
factor. We also aim at building a model which generates 
a graphical representation of the data generated after 
cleaning the dataset, we tend to remove unpleasant or 
derogatory terms which affects the mental well-being of 
users or people who reads the reviews, last but not least 
we plan on automating this manual labor thus reducing 
the time which the user of the product spends on it and 
creating a safe and healthy platform for all
The introductory part is further divided into the 
following section
1. Problem statement.
2. Motivation for solving the problem.
3. Solution.
4. Background knowledge
Sentiment Analysis is a popular in machine learning to 
analyze the text and find the polarity like positive and 
negative. We use the sentiment analysis in machine 
learning model to predict the emotion of a people based 
on the text written.
While working on this project we mainly relied on the 
sentimental analysis factor which these days has been a 
go to approach for almost each and every platform not 
only its one of the most used common approach but also 
it has a wide range of usefulness like
• Emotion detection
• Aspect based analysis.
• Multilingual sentiment analysis and comes with many 
benefits like
• Scaling and sorting of data
• Real time analysis
• Time saving factor
